Fastest: O(1) - Constant Time: Lightning-fast! The algorithm's speed doesn't depend on how much data you have. It's like finding your favorite book on a perfectly organized bookshelf – it takes the same amount of time, whether you have 10 books or 1,000 books.

Pretty Fast: O(log n) - Logarithmic Time: Still quite speedy! It grows slowly as you add more data. Think of it as finding a name in a phone book by repeatedly splitting it in half – it gets faster even if the phone book gets bigger.

Moderate: O(n) - Linear Time: Respectable speed! If you have twice as much data, it takes about twice as long. It's like looking through a list of names one by one to find a match.

Slower: O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time: It's faster than quadratic but slower than linear. Comparable to sorting a deck of cards quickly using smart techniques.

Slower Still: O(n^2) - Quadratic Time: Getting slower as you add data. Like checking every combination of items on a list against each other – not great for large lists.

Quite Slow: O(2^n) - Exponential Time: Now we're talking about slow! It grows rapidly as you add data. Imagine a puzzle where you have to try every possible combination – it's really slow even for small puzzles.

Incredibly Slow: O(n!) - Factorial Time: The slowest of all! It's like solving a complex puzzle where the number of possible arrangements explodes as you add more pieces. Practically unusable for large problems.
